/*
The video below will teach you a lot about the following :
Discovery Time , Lowest Discovery Node reachable etc.. which would be useful for Striver's video
*/

// Tarzan's alg : https://youtu.be/ZeDNSeilf-Y  (Just see what is discovery time and what is lowest discovery time node available and nothing else)

// Context : https://youtu.be/qrAub5z8FeA?list=PLgUwDviBIf0oE3gA41TKO2H5bHpPd7fzn

// Problem Link : https://leetcode.com/problems/critical-connections-in-a-network/

/*
Approach : We will create two arrays , one which would store the discovery time of the node
and
The second which would store the lowest discovery time of neighbour node (except parent)
